# methods

1st method

removing "fluff" from your code.
Don't Repeat Yourself - DRY

Conventions - Pascal Case

For the greeting - no additional input needed from 'outside'.
void refers to nothing (like Space, the final frontier)

When we call the method we have to include parenthesis even if, as in this case, there aren't any arguments.
The way you read the line is "Call the DisplayGreeting method, providing no arguments, and expecting no return."

/_ take input ----> _/
Use the argument, whatever the caller sent us.
Get some user input
RETURN that value as the output of this method.
The value in `userInput` will go wherever the
_CALLER_ of the method has specified.
return userInput;
